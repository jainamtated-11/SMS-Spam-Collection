# SMS Spam Collection Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying SMS messages as either **spam** or **ham** (not spam). We use machine learning techniques to build a model that can identify whether a given SMS message is spam based on its content.

The project aims to:
- Understand and preprocess text data.
- Apply machine learning models to text classification.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**, which contains a set of SMS messages labeled as either spam or ham. The dataset has 5,572 messages with two columns:
- **label**: `ham` or `spam`
- **message**: the actual SMS content

### Data Source
- The dataset was obtained from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Text Cleaning**: Removed punctuation, lowercased text, and removed stopwords.
2. **Tokenization**: Split the text into individual words.
3. **Vectorization**: Used TF-IDF to convert the text into numerical features.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-classifier.git
   cd sms-spam-classifier
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Model Building

For this project, I experimented with several machine learning models, including:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

After evaluating different models, the **Naive Bayes** classifier provided the best performance due to its suitability for text data and efficiency.

## Results

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|----------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression   | 97.2%    | 97.5%     | 94.8%  | 96.1%    |
| Naive Bayes           | 98.6%    | 99.0%     | 97.4%  | 98.2%    |
| Support Vector Machine| 98.1%    | 98.7%     | 96.5%  | 97.6%    |
| Random Forest         | 97.8%    | 98.1%     | 96.0%  | 97.0%    |

The **Naive Bayes** classifier performed the best overall, with the highest accuracy and F1-score.

## Confusion Matrix

Below is the confusion matrix for the Naive Bayes classifier:

```
[[963  12]
 [ 21 139]]
```

- True Positives (ham): 963
- True Negatives (spam): 139
- False Positives: 12
- False Negatives: 21

## Key Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed the raw text data.
- **Model Selection**: Compared different classifiers to choose the best-performing model.
- **Evaluation**: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as performance metrics.

## Conclusion

The **Naive Bayes** classifier proved to be the most effective for this task, with a high accuracy and excellent F1-score. The project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world text classification problems, especially in detecting spam messages in SMS communication.

## Next Steps

- Implement deep learning techniques like LSTM for further improvements.
- Explore other feature engineering techniques to enhance performance.
